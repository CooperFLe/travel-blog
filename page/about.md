# Me
Just the highlights. Computer Science major at The University of Texas at Dallas. I should graduate May 2020 if I don't seriously mess something up. I can be found taking pictures of people, write random snippets of code, or sleeping well into the afternoon.

# Studying Abroad
My sixth semester of college, I decided to study abroad in Germany. Why Germany? Easy, I like sausages. [Philipps-Universit√§t Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en) was the obvious choice for me because they offered an "Intensive German Course" with their program, and I knew exactly zero Germany.

Because I am majoring in Computer Science, Marburg doesn't have any classes that can count towards my degree plan. However, I entered college with enough credits from high school that I could've graduated a semester or two early. Instead of rushing through college, I decided it would be more useful to enjoy the college experience and take my time graduating by taking fewer hours and effectively taking a semester off in Germany.
